# TIPS FOR WEB SCRAPING 2025

### SeleniumBase: Web Scraping and Cloudflare Bypass  

SeleniumBase is a **Python web scraping and crawling tool** that allows you to run Selenium in **stealth mode** using **Undetected ChromeDriver (UC)**. It is more efficient than the main **Undetected ChromeDriver** library because it applies advanced browser patches to bypass anti-bot checks.  

Many developers use **SeleniumBase Cloudflare techniques** to improve their scraping success rate.

## üöÄ Installation  
Install the library using **pip**:  
```bash
pip3 install seleniumbase
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation  
### ‚úÖ Key Steps:
1. **Initialize the driver** in GUI mode with UC enabled.  
2. **Open the target URL** using UC mode with a 6-second reconnect time.  
3. **Click the CAPTCHA checkbox** if present.  
4. **Take a screenshot** of the web page.  
5. **Close the browser** and end the session.  

### ‚ú® Complete Code:
```python
from seleniumbase import Driver

# Initialize the driver in GUI mode with UC enabled
driver = Driver(uc=True, headless=False)

# Set the target URL
url = "https://www.scrapingcourse.com/cloudflare-challenge"

# Open URL using UC mode with a 6-second reconnect time to bypass initial detection
driver.uc_open_with_reconnect(url, reconnect_time=6)

# Click the CAPTCHA checkbox if present
driver.uc_gui_click_captcha()

# Take a screenshot of the current page and save it
driver.save_screenshot("cloudflare-challenge.png")

# Close the browser and end the session
driver.quit()
```

With this approach, **SeleniumBase** provides a more efficient way to bypass Cloudflare protections compared to the standard **Undetected ChromeDriver** library. üöÄ
